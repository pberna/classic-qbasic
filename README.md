# classic-qbasic
This is a repository to store some of my old programs written in old QBASIC when I was 15-16 years old. I was very young and a novice in programming, so please keep it in mind before looking at the code. 

There are monsters out there! ;)

If you want to run any of the programs, you can use qb64: http://www.qb64.net/
