# Laberynth
This is the first approach to implement a fake 3D game. The goal is to exit the maze the player is. To run the program you may use http://www.qb64.net/.
After installing it, run the file LABERIN2.BAS. 
The game come with a predefined maze (the editor is part of another program I will upload later). To play with it, you have to enter the following data asked by the console:
- **LABER1** (Uppercase, important)
- **39**
- **40**
- **2**
- **2**
- **este**
You will see something like this:

![Start Screen](screenshot1.png "Start Screen")

If you entered everything correctly, then the initial screen will show up:

![Entering the maze](screenshot2.png "Entering the maze")

Arrow keys will allow the player to move forward, backward, turn right and turn left. 
F1 will make the game to finish, and F2 will show you a map of the maze for a few seconds.

Of course, if you find the exit you will win the game. Enjoy!!
